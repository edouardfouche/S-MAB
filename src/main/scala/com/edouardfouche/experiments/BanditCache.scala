/**
  * Created by fouchee on 12.07.17.
  * This experiment pre-computes the bandit actions over the arms for our real-world experiment.
  * In the real-world experiment, "arms" = "pairs of attribute" and "action" = "compute MI"
  * In our case, we compute MI for pyrolisisbandit over a sliding window of size 1000 with step size 100
